    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For RAG-based applications, the accuracy of the generated response from Foundation Models (FMs) is dependent on the context provided to the model. Context is retrieved from the vector database based on the user query. Semantic search is widely used because it is able to understand more human-like questions—a user’s query is not always directly related to the exact keywords in the content that answers it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic search helps provide answers based on the meaning of the text. However, it has limitations in capturing all the relevant keywords. Its performance relies on the quality of the word embeddings used to represent meaning of the text. To overcome such limitations, you can combine semantic search with keyword search (hybrid search), which improve the relevance of search results.\n",

    "### Hybrid search\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid search takes advantage of the strengths of multiple search algorithms, integrating their unique capabilities to enhance the relevance of returned search results. For RAG-based applications, semantic search capabilities are commonly combined with traditional keyword-based search to improve the relevance of search results. It enables searching over both the content of documents and their underlying meaning.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/hybrid-overview.png\" width=\"50%\" height=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It works great for RAG-based applications where the retriever has to handle a wide variety of natural language queries. The keywords help cover specific entities in the query such as product name, color, and price, while semantics better understands the meaning and intent within the query. For example, if you have want to build a chatbot for an ecommerce website to handle customer queries such as the return policy or details of the product, using hybrid search will be most suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Benefits: </b>\n",
    "Both keyword and semantic search will return a separate set of results along with their relevancy scores, which are then combined to return the most relevant results."
